# Agentic Patterns

This directory contains **runnable reference implementations of common agentic design patterns**
built using **Google ADK (1.21+)**.

The focus is on illustrating **execution flow, control boundaries, and coordination patterns**
in event-driven agent systems.

Patterns are grouped by category (multi_agent, sessions, routing, chaining, reflection, parallelism)
and intentionally kept small and readable.

**Key Projects**
* multi_agent/travel_agent
* multi_agent/stock_analyst

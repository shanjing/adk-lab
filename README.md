# adk-lab

Reusable utilities and reference implementations for building
agentic systems using **Google ADK (1.21+)**.

This repository serves two complementary purposes:

1. **`adk_lab`** — a small, reusable Python package that provides
   utilities and helpers for ADK-based agent development.
2. **`agentic_patterns`** — a curated set of runnable reference
   implementations of common agentic design patterns built on
   top of Google ADK.
